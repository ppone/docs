## A/R Overview

The **A/R Overview** report gives you an overview of your accounts receivable activity over a time range. The report shows the aggregate amount invoiced, collected, and considered bad debt during the time period you selected. It will also produce standard collection metrics, like Days Sales Outstanding and Collections Efficiency. The report does not include detail on any of these activities. Instead, you can use one of the reports below to dig into the numbers.

## Communications

The **Communications** report shows you messaging and calling activity from your internal collection efforts. You can see activities performed by individual team members, like emails sent, phone calls made, etc. You can also see customer responses, like invoice views and bounced emails.

## A/R Aging

The **A/R Aging** report gives you a breakdown on the age of your currently outstanding invoices. An invoice's age is based on the number of days it has been outstanding or the number of days past due. You can choose whether to use the date or due date for aging in **Settings** &rarr; **General** &rarr; **Aging**.

Invoices by default are grouped into the following aging categories:
- 0-7 days old
- 8-14 days old
- 15-30 days old
- 31-60 days old
- 61+ days old

If you would like to change the aging ranges, you may change it in **Settings** &rarr; **General** &rarr; **Aging**.
